# Stock-Price-Prediction-using-RNN
Recurrent Neural Network uses Long short term memory(LSTM) to predict the upward and downward trends of stock price. LSTM is trained on 5 years of stock price and based on the correlation the predictions are made. This project focuses on predicting the upward or downward trend of the stock price and not the exact stock price.
